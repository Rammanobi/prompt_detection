🚨 Problem Statement: Prompt Injection & Malicious Prompt Attacks in LLM Systems

 📌 Background

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world applications such as chatbots, copilots, customer support systems, healthcare tools, and enterprise automation platforms. While powerful, these systems are highly vulnerable to malicious user prompts, including:

- Prompt injection attacks
- Jailbreak attempts
- Instruction overriding
- Data leakage and secret extraction
* Requests for illegal, harmful, or unethical actions

Attackers often disguise these prompts using paraphrasing, obfuscation, encoding, or multi-step conversational tactics, making traditional keyword-based filters ineffective.



⚠️ The Core Problem

Most existing AI safety mechanisms suffer from one or more of the following limitations:

- ❌ Rely only on static rules or keywords, which are easy to bypass
- ❌ Detect known attacks but fail on new or unseen prompt patterns
- ❌ Generate high false positives, blocking valid user queries
- ❌ Lack explainability, offering no clear reason for blocking
- ❌ Do not scale well with growing datasets and real-time usage

As a result, AI systems remain exposed to security risks, misuse, and reputational damage**, especially in sensitive or regulated domains.



🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to design and build a production-grade AI Firewall that can:

- Proactively detect and block malicious prompts **before** they reach the LLM
- Identify both **known and unknown attack patterns**
- Reduce false positives using intelligent review mechanisms
- Provide **clear, human-readable explanations** for blocked requests
- Scale efficiently for real-world deployment


💡 Proposed Solution

We introduce Antigravity (PromptShield) — a multi-layered prompt defense system that acts as a protective firewall between users and LLMs.

The system uses a five-layer waterfall architecture, where each layer performs a specialized safety check:

1. Semantic Similarity Detection
   Detects prompts that closely resemble known malicious or jailbreak examples using vector embeddings.

2. Deterministic Rule Engine
   Instantly blocks obvious threats using predefined safety rules and patterns.

3. Machine Learning Anomaly Detection
   Identifies suspicious or abnormal prompt behavior using a trained Random Forest classifier.

4. Automated AI Triage (Second LLM Review)
   Uses a trusted LLM to review borderline cases and reduce false positives.

5. Scalable Vector Infrastructure
   Enables cloud-scale storage and retrieval of prompt embeddings using managed vector databases.

Only prompts that pass all safety layers are forwarded to the generative AI model.



 ✅ Expected Impact

- 🛡️ Strong protection against prompt injection and jailbreak attacks
- 📉 Significant reduction in false positives and unsafe outputs
- 🧠 Transparent and explainable safety decisions
- ⚡ Low-latency, real-time prompt evaluation
- ☁️ Scalable architecture suitable for enterprise deployment



🧪 Scope of the Project

This project focuses on:

- Prompt-level security (input defense)
- Real-time detection and response
- AI-assisted moderation and review
- Cloud-ready deployment and scalability

It does not modify the internal weights of the LLM but acts as a secure, external control layer.



🏁 Conclusion

As LLM adoption grows,prompt-level security becomes a critical requirement.
Antigravity / PromptShield addresses this gap by providing a **robust, intelligent, and scalable AI Firewall, ensuring that AI systems remain **safe, trustworthy, and production-ready.
